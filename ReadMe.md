Add the Learn to Code (with) files for the Mock Up / Clock / Quiz to the repository - to be added via git to demo tomorrow.

? - how to make the clock accessible? telling time via an analogue means requires a visual  determining of where each hand is positioned in relation to numbers on the clock face. How to use the JS as means to presenting this information in a alternative format is the question I am mulling over.

All of these code with projects have a need to be reviewed against the fundamental WCAG requirements identified as part of the apprenticeship - and I think the quiz files have particular application when it comes to designing, developing and deploying a revision app for the Knowledge Test of the End Point Assessment for my apprenticeship. 

Want to complete code with projects for modals / draggable sort objects to bring some variety to the app. However, the Knowledge Test method itself is multiple choice so using solely using this method of assessment can be justified.
 

? - How do deploy code to purchased domain via git? 

HTML Periodic Table which is Independant Learn to Code project I am working on will be added in due course.

Inspiration for this project is the image from Atomic Design website - image will be added to the images folder of the project.
